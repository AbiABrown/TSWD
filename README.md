# About Me
My name is Abigail Brown. I'm a second year student in the Masters of Information Systems Management -- Business Intelligence and Data Analytics program in Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon. 

# What I Hope to Learn
While working, I've found that I sometimes implicitly expect people to understand and draw conclusions from data that I haven't presented in an organized and analyzed manner. I'm hoping I get better at presenting data in this course so I can leverage it better and communicate more effectively. Hopefully, after I graduate, I'll have a better intuition for what most people see when they look at presentations of data and be able to show it more effectively.
