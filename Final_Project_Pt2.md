# User Research
## Target Audience
I want to reach socially mobile adults in America who are about my age. Not everyone is interested in evironmental topics, but I'd like to target those who are at least not averse to them and financially capable of implementing my suggested call to action. At first I thought my target audience would be people who either lived in or were considering moving to the relevant area, but as I progressed through analyzing the data, I discovered that a more relevant audience would actually be people who lived outside that region. Since I know many people who live outside of the southwestern US and are in their 20s and 30s, I decided to call some people I knew and ask their opinions.

## Interview Script
Here are some of the goals I wanted to achieve through my interviews and the questions I devised to ask them.

## Interview Findings
Here are some of the transcripts from my interviews. I'm 'A' and my interviewees are each represented by one initial (not necessarily representing their actual names).
### Interview 1
'C', 27F, not a CMU student, residing in Georgia. College graduate, employed full-time.   
C: The landing page is really nice   
A: How was the flow of the presentation?   
C: physically, nice, because the pictures move, etc. and there’s mathematical data with cited sources, with explanations as well, explaining what means and why it’s important. You showed me and then told me why it was important and explained it.   
A: Was it too word-heavy and in need of more visuals?   
C: Visuals were fine, it can feel word heavy because I’m on the phone, so it feels like a lot of scrolling. It’s moderately word-heavy.   
A: Were the charts clear enough?   
C: Yes. I’m also a nerd, so…   
A: How was the color scheme?   
C: Very calming. I like the earth tone colors, because we’re talking about the world, basically, and that part of the world is kind of like that green, brown, soft colors. Definitely not hurting my eyes with neon or something. Good color choices.   
A: Do you feel like anything is missing?   
C: Yes. So, a hyperlink in the beginning that shows an agenda order and has hyperlinks to jump to those parts would be great. People like to skip through stuff nowadays, even short stuff.   
A: How do you feel about the length?   
C: It looks kind of long on the phone, but it’s not terribly long. It’s nice, short, to the point, clean, and concise. And then the sources, if you could add the actual hyperlink, that’d be nice.   
A: Do you feel inspired?   
C: Yeah. I learned something new today! I thought maybe some of the impacts might have been related to the fires in that part of the world. It helps eliminate some of the biases I had. You hit me with facts. The graphs are fine, but the only image that was odd was the river basin. I like to see blue for water and there was no blue.   
A: What else should I know?   
C: Where it says ‘by Abigail Brown’, the spacing is off. It’s too far down, but I'm also on my phone with it   
### Interview 2
'D', 28M, not a CMU student, residing in Kansas. College graduate, employed full-time.   
A: How was the flow of the presentation?   
D: It was pretty good. Fairly academic. It flowed pretty well. I did get bored reading the numbers though.   
A: Was it too word-heavy and in need of more visuals?   
D: I skipped most of the words. It’s too wordy for me. I’m not reading all these words, but I like the graphs.   
A: Were the charts clear enough?   
D: Once I read them, yes   
A: How was the color scheme?   
D: The color scheme was fine. That’s why the font stuck out to me. I wasn’t sure if I was supposed to pay attention to the red vs. black. But the overall color scheme was light on the eyes.   
A: Do you feel like anything is missing?   
D: You have one picture of a mountain. I like more pictures, but that’s just me   
A: How do you feel about the length?   
D: It was long. That was a lot. We could have cut some of those graphs out. I don’t care about those!   
A: Do you feel like it needs to be shortened?   
D: Yes.   
A: Any particular parts that need to be cut?   
D: Yeah, the charts. I don’t know which one was more important, but one of them.   
A: Do you feel inspired?   
D: I’m inspired… to contact my Senator and fire them   
A: What else should I know?   
D: The biggest thing is the awkward font color change.   
### Interview 3
'T', 26M, current CMU-Heinz student, residing in Pennsylvania.   
A: How was the flow of the presentation?   
T: The flow was good, I don't think there are any significant issues. The only spot for improvement may be the transition from looking at western pop correlation to the other pop correlation since it's motivation wasn't the most obvious   
A: Was it too word-heavy or in need of more visuals?   
T: I think it strikes a good balance, the graphics are all supportive of the text and nothing seems too forced   
A: Were the charts clear enough?   
T: The water levels one doesn't give a good sense of what the scale is and the correlation ones could be explained more before diving into them.   
A: How was the color scheme?   
T: earthy, very good for the topic   
A: Do you feel like anything is missing?   
T: could be slightly expanded on explaining the motivation for the correlation graphs more   
A: How did you feel about the length?   
T: aside from the answer to the previous question, it felt long enough to convey a story and didn't have anything that felt added just to take up space   
A: Do you feel inspired?   
T: No, I don’t live in Colorado   
A: What else should I know?   
T: Nothing that I can think of   
### Interview 4
'G', 26F, current CMU-Heinz student, residing in Pennsylvania.
A: How was the flow of the presentation?   
G: The flow makes sense. I think I got lost in the throughput vs population portion. Maybe a little more explanation as to how population is a factor. If you had some real word examples that may help, even just saying "more people = more food = more water diverted"      
A: Was it too word-heavy or in need of more visuals?   
G: There are A LOT of words, I think it helps the story, but I also think it could be summarized in some parts. The bullet points are nice but made it read like a scientific report and I found myself almost skipping the words at the end.    
A: Were the charts clear enough?   
G: Mostly. I'm not completely sure what some of the axis labels mean right away (eg Dec Mean). Maybe chart titles may help that, I figured it out after a while but it took me a minute.   
A: How was the color scheme?   
G: I like the colors but the text changing colors part way through made my eyes confused and I had to scroll back to make sure I didn't miss anything. I would also make the colors the same for all the graphs. By that I mean that you use orange for the US in the population growth map but then use blue in the next graph.   
A: Do you feel like anything is missing?   
G: I think theres a little bit of connection missing. It feels correlation-like not causation-like. I see the statement that 45% of the reason for the throughput...etc but I do not know where it came from. I didn't find that on any graph, even after going back through it..   
A: How did you feel about the length?   
G: Words are a lot but its not too long.    
A: Do you feel inspired?   
G: Kinda. The call to action reads boring. Maybe making the page more exciting would lead me to spend more time reading it.      
A: What else should I know?   
G: I think there is a lot of really good information in here    

# Identified changes for Part III
Not everyone felt the same way about certain aspects of the project, but here are some key takeaways I had that I intend to implement for Part III.   
Problem: the call to action is wordy and boring   
Change: Add pictures and cut down on the words. Maybe not all actions need to be bulleted out, so possibly cut one or two.   
Problem: There are errors in the color scheme, hyperlinks, and graph labels!   
Change: Correct the errors and clarify labeling.  
Problem: The correlation chart and the link to causation isn't clear   
Change: Clarify how the correlation charts work before introducing them. Also expound on why more people cause less water.   
Problem: It's a little word-heavy for some people   
Change: Add more pictures and cut out unnecessary words that don't necessarily add to the story   
Problem: The population and water level graph weren't introduced sufficiently   
Change: Make a smoother introduction to clarify the graphs   
Problem: The analysis wasn't clear   
Change: Clarify the significance of the statistical analysis used
Problem: Not everyone knows what "smoothing" data means   
Change: Add some more explanations of analysis methods so the uninitiated audience understands the analysis better.
