Of the three visualizations we've used, I think the first one was my favorite and the second one my least favorite. Having so many graphs on the page at once is a little overwhelming for me and makes it difficult for me to compare them. The bar chart provides a succinct summary quickly and the highlighting helps draw emphasis to certain areas. The treemap has a similar draw, but it isn't as easy to distinguish close values or for the reader to line up all countries in order, as the bar chart does this automatically. A strength of the treemap, though, is that it is rather appealing and interesting to look at, whereas bar and line charts can get dry rather quickly.   
I chose this visualization because it makes for an easy, quick comparison between multiple countries. The reader doesn't need to get caught up in the exact details of which country has more than another if they're quite close, but has the option of doing so by hovering over. I considered doing a comparison in the style of a gender across age chart, but decided it would be too similar to a bar graph.   
One humorous thing I found while working on this data is that the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand all have the same colors in their flags! I wanted to use colors that represented each country, but red, white, and blue are so popular with English speaking countries that my attempts quickly proved feeble. This led me to highlight the US and Canada in slightly darker tones, since they are usually the most relevant countries for us, and let the other three have slightly more muted and less true-to-flag colors. I also discovered that the default color schemes in Flourish don't adjust when custom colors are added to other cells. This led me to manually adjust some of the grayscale cells so they would be less distracting.
