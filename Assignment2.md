#### Analysis
Of the three visualizations we've used, I think the first one was my favorite and the second one my least favorite. Having so many graphs on the page at once is a little overwhelming for me and makes it difficult for me to compare them. The bar chart provides a succinct summary quickly and the highlighting helps draw emphasis to certain areas. The treemap has a similar draw, but it isn't as easy to distinguish close values or for the reader to line up all countries in order, as the bar chart does this automatically. A strength of the treemap, though, is that it is rather appealing and interesting to look at, whereas bar and line charts can get dry rather quickly.   
I chose a treemap because it makes for an easy, quick comparison between multiple countries. The reader doesn't need to get caught up in the exact details of which country has more than another if they're quite close, but has the option of doing so by hovering over. I considered doing a comparison in the style of a gender across age chart, but decided it would be too similar to a bar graph. I settled on the treemap because I consider the format engaging but still able to provide useful information.   
One humorous thing I found while working on this data is that the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand all have the same colors in their flags! I wanted to use colors that represented each country, but red, white, and blue are so popular with English speaking countries that my attempts quickly proved futile. This led me to highlight the US and Canada in slightly darker tones, since they are usually the most relevant countries for us North Americans, and let the other three have slightly more muted and less true-to-flag colors. I also discovered that the default color schemes in Flourish don't adjust when custom colors are added to other cells. This led me to manually adjust some of the grayscale cells so they would be less distracting.     
Finally, I was rather disappointed in the selection I had in countries. I was initally interested in comparing two countries like the US and China, but the data seemed to mainly consist of other nations that are friendly or allied with the US. This makes sense, as less friendly countries might not want to share their data publicly, but I still found it disappointing and chose to settle for (what I consider) a slightly less engaging angle on the data. This is also why I chose to loosely label the countries in the dataset the "free world", though it is by no means all-inclusive in its listing.      
Somewhat disappointingly, there didn't seem to be much of a correlation between these countries all speaking the same language when comparing them to the other nations in the dataset. I was hoping for a trend but didn't really notice one once I highlighted the countries of interest. Rather, it looks like the debt may correlate more closely to the size of each nation. I wasn't able to confirm or disprove this given the data on OECD, but I think it would be interesting for further investigation. Perhaps this dataset could be crossed with public census data so more conclusions could be drawn
