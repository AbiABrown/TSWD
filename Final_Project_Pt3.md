# The Final Story
Here's a link to the final version of the Colorado River story: [Shorthand Story](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/colorado-river-levels-and-population-growth-draft1/index.html)   

## Changes Since Part 2
Although much of the final version was complete after Part II, I did make a few small modifications.   
Based on the feedback I got from the interviews, I adjusted the colors to be a little more uniform and got rid of the default distracting orange. I shortened the call to action section to make it easier to digest. I also worked to rephrase a few sections of the words to add clarity (particularly around the correlation section) and adjusted some of the formatting in Shorthand. I added a couple more callout graphics from the Noun Project toward the end and added some icons to all of the callouts to make the presentation easier on the eyes. I also added a background picture of the Hoover Dam to one of the sections.   
Overall, my changes since Part 2 focused on design and visuals, rather than content. I didn't get a whole lot of suggested improvements on the content from part 2, but I did get some suggestions for improving the visuals and overall appeal of the design and story.

## The Audience
I elected to generally stay with the audience I identified in part 2. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get any interviews with non-college graduates. For this reason, I've narrowed my audience to college educated persons between 20 and 30 because I'm not sure how people who may not be as familiar with graphs would respond. Most of the specific changes I made on account of the interviews I did get are noted in the above section.   
I think a few notes on who my audience *wasn't* may be relevant here. I did not tailor my presentation to anyone who is in search of evidence for (or against) global warming. I consider that outside the scope of this project. I did not tailor my presentation for anyone who is not an American or living in the United States, though I'd be more than happy if any non-Americans found it interesting or were inspired to investigate a water source in their own country. I expect the presentation could be quite interesting and relevant for people outside of my focused age and education demographic, but I did not research opinions outside of it, so I will not make any claims about the relevancy to other age and education demographics.   
As a last note on the audience, I originally thought my audience would be Americans with enough mobility to choose whether to migrate within the United States. I believed my story would result in a call to action to limit population growth and migration to the southwest. As I analyzed the data, however, I discovered that it told a different story than I originally anticipated. Rather than the western population affecting river throughput the strongest, the population of the rest of the US did. This broadened my audience to Americans who weren't necessarily as mobile, but merely had enough capital to make intentional decisions about where the products they purchase originate. This change developed more between Parts 1 & 2 than 2 & 3, but I think it's worth mentioning anyways.   

## Final Thoughts / Behind the Scenes
This project was quite engaging for me and somewhat enjoyable. I really appreciated being able to pick my own topic. I learned new things about the river levels as I examined the data and drew different conclusions than I originally expected. In hindsight, these conclusions perhaps should have been more obvious, but I honestly didn't see them until after I analyzed the data. Working through joining data from two very different sources was interesting and ended up going more smoothly than I anticipated. The census data is only collected once every ten years, but the river data was collected daily (I pulled the annual data, but daily was available). Furthermore, the average annual river throughput changes so dramatically year-to-year that annual data did not make a useful visualization. These two challenges ended up counteracting each other, since the ten-year average throughput was much more meaningful and easier to pull trends from and ten years coincided with census collection. Conveniently, this method also yielded a much higher r^2 value than I was anticipating. Interpolating census data to the annual level led to a much, much lower correlation, so perhaps the only reason I was able to make this project at all was because the census is only taken once every ten years.   
Aside from the intricacies of working with this particular data, I found it interesting how much colors matter to an audience. A story and visualization may be great, but one offputting color will ruin the whole experience for some people.   
It's crazy how few maps are in the public domain! I'm quite grateful the Library of Congress had one I could use.

# Final thoughts
I'm not sure if my visuals were the most exciting. I don't know that there's a better representation than line graphs for correlations, though.   
I wanted to keep my scope narrow, but if I were to expand it, I would definitely have wanted to include precipitation levels and see if that was a better explanation for water throughput.    
Finally, for the presentation, I elected to use the word, "levels", rather than "throughput", as I thought that would communicate the main idea to the audience. These two words aren't exactly interchangeable, but I thought they were close enough that the audience would still get the main idea and would be less likely to get confused.
