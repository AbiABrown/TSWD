# Outline
I. Summary. I want to showcase data on the Colorado River levels near the Grand Canyon over the past century and compare any water throughput trends with any trends in population growth in the area.   
II. Background. The path of the Colorado River is from the Rocky Mountains in Colorado to the Gulf of California [Source](https://www.uncovercolorado.com/activities/colorado-river/). (I may include the map from this source if I find it is in the public domain). However, in recent decades, the river has not reached the ocean [Source](https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2023-01-31/colorado-river-in-crisis-the-rivers-end). As a major water source for seven US states and two Mexican states, this is a serious and contentious issue [Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/02/05/colorado-river-drought-explained/). Many factors, such as weather, global warming, and increased usage are blamed, but I'd like to focus on an easily measurable factor: local usage.   
III. The Story. Roughly, the story should be that the river is critical to the region, that the levels have been dropping, and then how the population has been affecting those dropping levels. Finally, the conclusion and call to action will inspire the readers to consider what they can do personally about this crisis.   
IV. Data used. As a proxy for how much water is being used, I'd like to examine population data in states that utilize the river's resources. I will take this data from the US Census Bureau [census.gov](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/dec/popchange-data-text.html). To narrow my focus on river levels, I will specifically be examining the annual discharge in cubic feet per second from a particular location. Right now, I intend to use the Grand Canyon measurements, because Arizona is fairly downstream and past the Hoover Dam, and the Grand Canyon is a well-known location for the audience (at least compared to other available choices). I haven't analyzed the data yet, so if this location proves to be less than useful, I may pick another location further downstream.   
V. Data analysis and presentation order. I expect I will use a line chart with a single line to show the river's levels throughout time. I will then use a line chart, probably with multiple lines (one for each of the seven states), to show population growth during the same timespan. I may alter this idea slightly if I find the multi-line chart isn't visually appealing. Next, I intend to show the overall population and the river levels together on the same line chart. I'm not sure if I'll run any kind of analysis on their correlation, but that's a possible direction the project could take.   
VI. Call to action. This is the most subject to change, as I have not run an analysis on the data yet. The call to action could take on a couple different directions, depending on the results of the analysis. Some possible calls are:   
  1. The river levels haven't significantly changed. This would result in the call to action being to not worry and carry on business-as-usual. The Colorado River will be fine and we humans can continue to eat our winter vegetables and move west.
  2. The river levels have dropped significantly, but it's uncorrelated with population growth. The call to action would be to exercise caution; there may not be anything we can do about a natural drought (or a drought caused by global human activity), but anyone who lives near the river can be conscious not to waste the little water they have and the rest of us can pay attention to where our produce comes from.
  3. The river levels have dropped significantly, and it's definitely correlated with population growth. The call to action would be to think twice about moving out to an area that depends on the river. Our current course of action regarding water distribution may not be sustainable, and the readers may want to exercise caution if considering relocating to a state that depends on the river and its tributaries for water. Non-local readers may want to be more mindful of where their produce comes from.     
I expect this last option will be the most likely outcome, but I don't want to jump to any conclusions before analyzing the data. It may also be that there is a weaker conclusion drawn that will result in a hybrid between two of the calls.
#### Note on the Outline
I expect the details of the presentation will shift as I analyze the data, so I do not expect that this outline is the final version.
# Initial Sketches
Coming soon
# The Data
As a proxy for how much water is being used, I'd like to examine population data in states that utilize the river's resources. I will take this data from the US Census Bureau [census.gov](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/dec/popchange-data-text.html). I will keep the data for these seven states (Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, Nevada, California, Arizona, and New Mexico) separate to see if I find any interesting patterns while analyzing. I will, however, combine them for certain key visualizations. Due to the large size of California and its relatively short border with the river, I may have to do more research to find out which parts of California depend on the river and narrow the census data to just those counties.   
To narrow my focus on river levels, I will specifically be examining the annual discharge in cubic feet per second from a particular location. Right now, I intend to use the Grand Canyon measurements, because Arizona is fairly downstream and past the Hoover Dam, and the Grand Canyon is a well-known location for the audience (at least compared to other available choices) [USGS](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/annual?referred_module=sw&search_site_no=09402500&format=sites_selection_links). I haven't analyzed the data yet, so if this location proves to be less than useful, I may pick another location further downstream or incorporate multiple locations. I may also include the southernmost US point, since this point may tell a more compelling story than the Grand Canyon will.   
If I think my visualizations have unusual patterns during certain years, I may include years that major dams (like the Hoover Dam) were installed and see if they help explain these unusual patterns. Since these are individual, single points of data, I will likely use several sources for them, if I use them at all.
# Method & Medium
As of right now, I plan to use Shorthand to document this project. I intend the order of the story to be a brief background, charts as proposed in the data analysis portion of the outline above, then a brief conclusion and call to action. For the sake of honesty, I will probably include notes at the end that are not critical to the story to acknowledge shortcomings in the methodology (obviously, the population of the states doesn't explain EVERYTHING). Depending on how the project goes, I may elect to add more visualizations, perhaps separating upper and lower basin states or isolating California.
